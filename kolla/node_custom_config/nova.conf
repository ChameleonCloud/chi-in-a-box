# Ironic and takes a very long time, and also interferes with instance claims
# as part of deploys. The only thing it gives us is automatically adding/removing
# baremetal nodes when they are added/removed from the system. That happens
# so irregularly, though, and a complete sync happens on restart of the
# nova_compute_ironic process anyways. This sync is still useful to catch weird
# things, like an orphaned instance or something, so we'll still run it, albeit
# very infrequently (12 hours).

#   failures. Furthermore, bare metal nodes, managed by a disabled
#   compute service, will be remapped to a different one. That may cause
