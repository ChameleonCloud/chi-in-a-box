# This file defines your basic site configuration
# IMPORTANT: You MUST provide valid values for items marked "MANDATORY"
# Some sections may be further customized to your needs

# MANDATORY: Define your Region name
# Specified as a string of all-uppercase characters, starting with "CHI@"
# Example: CHI@XYZ
##openstack_region_name: CHI@XYZ

# MANDATORY: Define your Chameleon site name
# Specified as a string of lower-case characters; by convention, this
#   should match the portion of the "openstack_region_name" after the "@"
# This is used for out-of-band inventory management
##chameleon_site_name: xyz

# MANDATORY: Enable/disable HP Proxy configuration
# Specified as "yes" or "no"
##enable_haproxy: yes

# What is the base Linux distro for your install?
# Valid Values:
#   centos = (DEFAULT) Assumes CentOS7
#   ubuntu = Assumes Ubuntu 18.04
##kolla_base_distro: {centos|ubuntu}

# MANDATORY: Should Kolla be configured to utilize TLS encryption?
# Valid Values:
#   no = Do not utilize TLS (you can still add it later)
#   yes = Use TLS; all of the files needed for the full TLS chain
#       must already be present in /etc/kolla/haproxy/certs.d/
# NOTE: If set to "yes", then the FQDN defined in kolla_external_fqdn
#       MUST match the FQDN specified in the certificate
##kolla_enable_tls_external: no

# MANDATORY: Define IPv4 network address for Ironic's internal
#   provisioning subnet; this should be an address in the same
#   network assigned to "eno3" but NOT be the same as any address
#   the OS configuration actually binds to the NIC
# NOTE: This IP must reside in the same subnet as defined in
#   ironic_dnsmasq_dhcp_range
##kolla_internal_vip_address: 172.16.0.10

# IMPORTANT: For the next two items, the IP address should reverse-resolve
#   to the FQDN, and the FQDN should resolve to the IP

# MANDATORY: Define IPv4 network address for Chameleon's public
#   web interface; this should be an address in the same network
#   assigned to "eno1", but should NOT be the same as any address
#   the OS configuration actually binds to the NIC
##kolla_external_vip_address: 1.2.3.4

# MANDATORY: Define the FQDN of the Chameleon host
# NOTE: If using TLS, then this must match the FQDN of the certificate
##kolla_external_fqdn: chi-xyz.example.tld
