# You can use this file to override _any_ variable throughout Kolla.
# Configuration is read from the following locations, with entries
# lower in the list overriding those above.
# - 'chi-in-a-box/venv/src/kolla-ansible/ansible/group_vars/all.yml' # Don't edit this
# - 'chi-in-a-box/kolla/defaults.yml' # Don't edit this
# - 'site-config/defaults.yml'
# - 'site-config/inventory/group_vars/<group_name>.yml' # Scoped to group
# - 'site-config/inventory/host_vars/<hostname>.yml' # Scoped to host
# Prefer editing site-config/defaults.yml (this file) for site-wide configuration
# And editing a host_vars file for host-specific overrides
