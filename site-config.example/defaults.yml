# HAProxy
# --------------------
#
# This default configuration runs without HAProxy in order to make it easier
# to evaluate CHI-in-a-Box. In production, HAProxy requires that you have
# additional VIP (Virtual IP) addresses, which is used for high-avaiability.
# Additionally, HAProxy use requires TLS certificates.
#
enable_haproxy: no
# If using, place a full TLS chain in node_custom_config/certificates/haproxy.pem
kolla_enable_tls_external: "{{ enable_haproxy }}"
# If using HAProxy, set to a "spare" address in the "internal" subnet
kolla_internal_vip_address: "{{ api_interface_address }}"
# If using HAProxy, set to a "spare" address in the "public" subnet
kolla_external_vip_address:
# If using HAProxy, this should resolve to the external_vip and match the TLS Cert
