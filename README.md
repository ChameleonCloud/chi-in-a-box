Ansible playbooks for deploying Chameleon operations systems

## Development setup

This requires Vagrant and Virtualbox (with guest additions) if you want to test playbooks locally.

### Mac OS X

```
brew cask install vagrant
brew cask install virtualbox
# Install guest additions for Virtualbox, needed for file syncing
vagrant install vagrant-vbguest
```
