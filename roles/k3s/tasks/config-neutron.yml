# FIXME(jason): this doesn't actually add the subnet to the router!
# When we have updated to a later Ansible we can potentially fetch the router's
# interfaces with routers_info and then merge this interface into the list?
# Update (Soufiane June 25 2024) This still does not add the subnet to the router
# two extra manual steps have to be performed after the succesful execution of this task
# 1. Add the caliconet-subnet as an internal interface to the admin router
# 2. Add an external gateway to the public network
# Both of the above are pre-requisites to the proper functioning of floating ips to containers
